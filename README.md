# SlowFaller
Temporarily rebinds the jump key to a slow fall spell when falling.

<p>This is a small lightweight addon that will temporarily rebind your jump key to a slow fall ability, currently available to Priests, Mages, and Druids in Moonkin Form. This doesn't work while mounted and doesn't work while in combat. If you're not one of the qualifying classes, the addon won't run any code at all, simply giving you a chat message telling you such. Let me know if there's additional conditions that conflict with this addon, I tried to make sure it doesn't overwrite the dragonriding / double jump anti-gravity packs / faerie dust abilities, but I could have missed some others.</p>

<h3>tl;dr double-jump to cast slow fall, levitate, or flap.</h3>
