# SlowFaller
Temporarily rebinds the jump key to a slow fall spell when falling.

<p>This is a small lightweight addon that will temporarily rebind your jump key to a slow fall ability, such as Priests, Mages, and Druids in Moonkin Form. This doesn't work while mounted and doesn't work while in combat. A new redesign and menu has also been added to allow choosing the ability cast upon double jump for any class. Let me know if there's additional conditions that conflict with this addon, I tried to make sure it doesn't overwrite the dragonriding / double jump anti-gravity packs / faerie dust abilities, but I could have missed some others.</p>

<p>Access the menu by typing /slowfaller</p>

<h3>tl;dr double-jump to cast slow fall, levitate, or flap.</h3>
